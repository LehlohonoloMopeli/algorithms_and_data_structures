    Notes on linked lists:
        1. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a group of nodes
        2. Each node in a linked list contains data and a pointer to the next node
        3. The last node in a linked list does not have a pointer to the next node
        4. Linked lists need more memory than arrays because they store data and references to other nodes
        5. The first node in a linked list is called the head node
        6. The last node in a linked list is called the tail node
        7. Finding an arbitrary item in a linked list is O(n) linear time
        
    Advantages:
        1. Linked lists are faster than arrays
        2. Linked lists are more flexible than arrays
        3. Efficient in inserting and deleting elements
        4. It cannot have holes in the data so there is no need to shift items around
        5. Items are not stored next to each other in memory so there is no random indexing
        6. Linked lists allow us to create more complex data structures such as stacks and queues
        7. inserting items at the beginning of the data structure is O(1)
